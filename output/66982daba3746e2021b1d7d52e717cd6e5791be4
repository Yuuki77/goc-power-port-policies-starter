Move ectool out of reporters

Upcoming CL's will add extended ectool functionality, which are not all
reporter-like in nature. This CL moves firmware/reporters/ectool.go out
of the reporters sub-directory in preparation for additional ectool
methods.

This CL also includes a few other minor changes to support this move:
1. Creates an ECTool struct, so that we don't need to keep passing DUT
   and so that we can track stateful information. Hopefully this will
   also make code easy to read.
2. Renames ECVersion() to Version(), to avoid redundancy.
3. Minorly refactors Version to call dut.Conn().Command() directly,
   rather than using the Reporter's CommandOutput wrapper. Accordingly,
   operates on the []byte outputted by dut.Conn().Command().
4. Updated ECVersion test to match the new method signature.
5. Added some comments inside Version.
